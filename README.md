# console-chat
A home console chat training project.

You can chat between host and client instances, make sure to give the program firewall permissions if you want to try it. I only tested it on LAN and locally(the same computer is host and client).

I didn't get to debug the program thoroughly yet. Sometimes sent message is shown after a longer amount of time(you can make it appear instantly if you send a message). Maybe because signal processing is not prioritized when window is in background.

This project uses GPL open source license distribution of Qt.
